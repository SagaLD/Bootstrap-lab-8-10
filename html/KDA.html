					    		<p>K/DA is a virtual K-pop girl group consisting of four themed versions of League of Legends characters: Ahri, Akali, Evelynn and Kai'Sa. Evelynn and Kai'Sa were voiced by American singers Madison Beer and Jaira Burns respectively until the announcement of a new extended play in August 2020, where it was revealed that the two were to be replaced by Bea Miller and Wolftyla for the foreseeable future. Ahri and Akali have been voiced by (G)I-dle members Miyeon and Soyeon through both incarnations of the group. K/DA was developed by Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, and unveiled at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship with an augmented reality live performance of their first song, "Pop/Stars". A music video of the song uploaded to YouTube subsequently went viral, surpassing 100 million views in one month, and reaching over 300 million views, as well as topping Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. This would be followed up with the release of a promotional single in August 2020, entitled "The Baddest".</p>

								<p>The conception of K/DA was based on Riot's expressed desire to create more musical content in the future, with the characters chosen based on K-pop archetypes. The band was created to promote the League World Championship and to sell in-game K/DA skins of the characters in League of Legends. K/DA has subsequently achieved significant popularity both within and beyond the League of Legends fandom, and received critical acclaim, especially for their performance during the World Championship and the impact of gaming on the music scene.</p>
